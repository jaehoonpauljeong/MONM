[03/20/2024] Discussion on MONM for IETF-120
- Make a design team for the MONM (Mobile Object Network Management) Problem Statement 
and Use Cases
 . Mobile Objects: SDV (Software-Defined Vehicle), Vehicles, UAM (Urban Air Mobility), 
 and UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) like drones.
 . Goal: To address the necessity of a unified "Interface to Mobile Object Network Functions (I2MONF)",
   such as Interfaces to Service Functions (e.g., network, security, and application services) 
   in Mobile Objects.
 . Those interfaces are modeled on the basis of YANG and NETCONF/RESTCONF. They may also be modeled 
   on the basis of YAML and REST API.
 
- [Jung-Soo Park] Definition of Mobile Objects
 . Mobile Objects can contain Physical Objects like SDVs and Software Objects like containers
   and in-network computing functions.

- [Chris Shen] 
  . Major part is how to design the interaction of in-vehicle networks and
  the interaction of in-vehicle network and edge network.
  . The 3rd party need to access data in mobile objects' networks and considerations on security and privacy.
  . Industrial frameworks can be utilized, such as CAMERA, TM Forum, and GSMA to extend the MONM Framework.
  . We can consider more applications.
  
- [Paul Jeong]
 . We need to use the i2nsf mailing list to discuss MONM BoF.
 . Mailing List: i2nsf@ietf.org
